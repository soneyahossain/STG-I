Evaluation 1 - Sep 2020
-----------------------

Requirement 1: Velocity smoothing respects kinematic profile

Constraints:
- maximum velocity
- maximum acceleration
- maximum jerk

State (current trajectory):
- velocity
- acceleration
- jerk

Set following variables to be symbolic:
traj.v, max_vel
traj.a, max_accel
traj.j, max_jerk

Inputs to VelocitySmoothing, aka initial conditions
- initial acceleration
- initial velocity
- initial position

Main usage pattern seems to be:
[0] goal: given initial conditions, fastest time to reach setpoint velocity
(1) set initial conditions
(2) call updateTrajectory at time 0 to get total time
(3) compute number of steps given dt
(4) repeatedly call updateTrajectory(dt, velocity setpoint)
(5) at the end we should have reached our target velocity setpoint
